# NOTES

-   This file is *not* included in the [source package](https://r-pkgs.org/structure.html#sec-source-package) because of the [`.nopurl` suffix in its
    filename](https://pkgpurl.rpkg.dev/reference/purl_rmd.html#-rmd-files-excluded-from-purling).

-   The chunks below have to be manually executed in order to update the backed up data.

# Setup

```{r}
library(rlang,
        include.only = c("%|%", "%||%"))
library(magrittr,
        include.only = c("%>%", "%<>%", "%T>%", "%!>%", "%$%"))
```

# Back up data from `sudd.ch`

```{r}
rdb::list_sudd_rfrnds(use_cache = FALSE) |>
  rdb::sudd_rfrnds(use_cache = FALSE) |>
  readr::write_rds(file = "data-raw/backups/sudd.rds",
                   compress = "xz",
                   version = 3L)
```
