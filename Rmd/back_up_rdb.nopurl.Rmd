# NOTES

-   This file is *not* included in the [source package](https://r-pkgs.org/package-structure-state.html#source-package) because of the [`.nopurl` suffix in the

-   The chunks below have to be manually executed in order to update the backed up data.

```

# Back up RDB data

```{r}
rdb::rfrnds(is_draft = NULL,
            incl_archive = TRUE,
            use_cache = FALSE) |>
  readr::write_rds(file = "data-raw/backups/rdb.rds",
                   compress = "xz",
