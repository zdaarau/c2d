  password = getOption("c2d.credentials")[1L]
)
}
\arguments{

\description{
Creates a new user session token if necessary. The token is stored in the R option \code{c2d.user_session_tokens}, a \link[tibble:tbl_df-class]{tibble} with the columns
\code{email}, \code{token} and \code{date_time_last_active}.
}
\details{
By default, the \code{email} and \code{password} are read from the first element of the R option \code{c2d.credentials} (a named character vector where names are e-mail
addresses and values are passwords).

User session tokens expire automatically after 15 days of inactivity.
