Dear XYZ

You can use the R package [**rdb**](https://rdb.rpkg.dev/) to access the data from the database, which we're in the middle of rebranding to *Referendum Database (RDB)*.

We wrote a short [introduction](https://rdb.rpkg.dev/articles/rdb.html) which should help get you started. The corresponding codebook is found [here](https://rdb.rpkg.dev/articles/codebook.html).

Please report any issues you may encounter with the R package [on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/zdaarau/rpkgs/rdb/-/issues).

I hope I could help.

Best regards,
Salim
